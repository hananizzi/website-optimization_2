All external css and javascript files were minified and added to the actual html files.
I used the Javascript code from Google fonts to import Open Sans font file.

To optimmize pizza.html, all css files were minified and were placed under the head tag. The pizzeria.jpg was resized to 360px by 270px, reducing the file size from 2.4MB to 18KB (yay!)
main.js was also minified and the script was inserted in the body of pizza.html.
